# robot-gladiators

==================

# In this first lesson, we'll use JavaScript to code a single round of Robot Gladiators. When we're done, the game will follow this sequence:

## 1. The game will prompt the player to name their robot.

## 2. The player's robot will be initialized with the following properties:

    a. 100 health points
    b. 10 attack points
    c. 10 money points

## 3. The player's opponent, Roborto, will be initialized with the following properties:

    a. 50 health points
    b. 12 attack points

## 4. The game will display "Welcome to Robot Gladiators!"

## 5. The game will prompt the player to either fight the round or skip it.

## 6. If the player chooses to skip:

    a. A penalty of 10 money points will be deducted from the player's robot.
    b. The game will end.

## 7. If the player chooses to fight:

    a. The player's robot will attack Roborto, and the player-robot's attack points will be deducted from Roborto's health points.
    b. The game will display Roborto's remaining health points.
    c. Roborto will attack the player's robot, and Roberto's attack points will be deducted from the player's robot's health points.
    d. The game will display the player-robot's remaining health points.

## 8. The game will end.
